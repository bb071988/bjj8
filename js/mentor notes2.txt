document.ready - pass anonymous variable - that is part of that js not part of the window.

// will break minification

public functions - private functions etc..

On a scale application - mykey would be exposed.  Closure with other closures.  Variables and methods where children have access to the parent
anonymous function in beginning couldn't be accessed elsewhere.

Key would be initialized from a server done in namespace so nothing else would have access there.

Google asks what url can use the key.

Foursquare - Does not implement this in the API.

// var - lastResponse;  // if we ever get to window answer is always yes so it will declare it.  Without a var it will automatically proceed up in chain of questioning.

vars should be declared at the top of the functions vs at the -
